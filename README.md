I recently designed a complete UI experience for a coffee shop concept using Figma — blending aesthetics with functionality to create a warm, inviting digital space. 🌿

Key features of the design:

✅ Elegant landing page with the title “Coffee Heaven”

✅ Smooth navigation and user-friendly layout

✅ Sections like Taste the Magic, Bean Varieties, Fresh Coffee, Coffee & Pastry, and New Technology with short, engaging taglines

✅ Visual consistency, cozy color palette, and modern fonts

This project was all about capturing the cozy essence of a real café while maintaining a clean and intuitive user flow for customers to explore menus, special offers, and coffee stories. 🌍✨
